# Style Guide

This code style guide reproduces common conventions for Python programming. While rules can be occasionally bent with justification, most programming work in this course should follow these guidelines.

## Naming

### Variable names

Variable names should be descriptive, concise, and lowercase with words separated by underscores as in `snake_case`. Avoid single letter names for variables because a single letter usually fails to describe the values contained in a variable, with the exception of loop variables. Avoid Python keywords, such as `class`, `print`, `import`, or `return`, or names of built-in functions or types, such as `len`.

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
factor
total_weight
data1        # Okay to have a number right after a word
```
:::

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
x            # Most likely not descriptive enough,
             # except for something like an (x, y) coordinate
totalWeight  # Not using snake_case
NewImage     # Not using snake_case
newresult    # Not separating words with underscores
return       # Python keyword
len          # Python built-in function
```
:::

### Function names

Function names should be descriptive, concise, and lowercase with words separated by underscores as in `snake_case`. As with variable names, avoid names of built-in Python functions. We usually specify the function names in the specification, so make sure to name your functions accordingly.

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
get_height(person)
plot_population(df)
```
:::

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
setScore(record)  # not using snake_case
max()             # will overwrite the built-in max function in Python
```
:::

When writing test functions, the name of your test function should clearly indicate which function it is testing. For example, a test for the function `add_two_numbers` might be named `test_add_two_numbers`.

## Whitespace

### Indentation

Unlike other languages that use explicit delimiters to determine what goes inside a loop or function (such as `{}` in Java), Python only uses indentation. Indentation affects the behavior of programs. `IndentationError: unexpected indent` means there is an error in code indentation.

### Blank lines

Leave two blank lines separating code for different function definitions, class definitions, and other code. The only exception is for methods defined within the same class, in which case a single blank line between methods is preferred.

Within a function definition, avoid introducing more than a single blank line at a time and only for separating complex chunks of code for readability. Careful and consistent of two blank lines can help communicate the start of a significant, new definition.

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
def the_first_function():
    # Implementation for the first function


def the_second_function():
    # Implementation for the second function
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
def compute_avg(x, y, z):
    """
    Sums the given three numbers and returns the average.
    """
    sum_val = x + y + z

    # Compute and return the average value
    result = sum_val / 3.0
    return result
```
:::

### Between operators

Include spaces between operators and other elements in an expression. Mathematical operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `**`. Logical operators include `==`, `<=`, `>=`, `<`, and `>`.  Limit space delimiters to 1 space to avoid unnecessary whitespace. The exception to this is parentheses, which can be directly adjacent to whatever they are enclosing.

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
x + y
(total ** 2) + 4 * val - 1
x * (4 + 6)
b + math.sqrt(4 * max_val)
```
:::

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
x+y                             # not enough spaces
(total**2)+4*val-1              # not enough spaces
x * ( 4 + 6 )                   # unnecessary spaces around parentheses
b +  math.sqrt( 4 *   max_val)  # inconsistent spacing
```
:::

This does not apply when specifying default parameter values or keyword arguments. Avoid spaces around the assignment operator `=` for those cases.

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
def add_three_nums(a, b, c=10):
    return a + b + c


add_three_nums(b=20, a=20, c)
```
:::

### Function calls

Include spaces between arguments in a function call. Avoid space(s) between the function name and its argument list. Adding space(s) incorrectly suggests that the parentheses are for grouping an expression when they actually indicate a function call.

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
x = math.sqrt(n)
range_vals = range(n, 4)
```
:::

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
x = math.sqrt (n)        # too much space before the parenthesis
range_vals = range(n,4)  # no spaces between parameters
```
:::

## Line length

In general, lines should not exceed 100 characters. Occaisional exceptions are permitted when a longer line would be clearer and easier to understand than two or more shorter lines. Avoid long lines with the following strategies.

Function calls
: ```python
  some_function(first_arg="This is a function",
                second_arg="With many arguments",
                third_arg="indent until everything lines up")
  ```

Expressions
: ```python
  total = (first_num + second_num + third_num
           + fourth_num + fifth_num)
  ```

Strings
: ```python
  print("For very very very very very very long strings, "
        "this is how we might break it up to two lines")
  ```

## Documentation

Each function should contain a docstring describing what the function does right below the function definition. It should describe any parameters the function takes and values it returns (if any). If the code requires handle some special cases (like case sensitivity, or special returns values for a certain input), include that in the comment as well. The `main` method does not require a comment.

Long blocks of particularly complex code can be explained by including a comment `#` on the preceding line(s).

```python
def add_two_numbers(a, b, return_zero=False):
    """
    This function returns the sum of the two given numbers a, b
    if return_zero is False. Otherwise returns 0.
    return_zero has False as its default value.
    """
    if return_zero:
        return 0
    else:
        return a + b
```

Avoid information that is unnecessary or irrelevant to clients (end-users of your work), such as "initialize variable" or "nested for loop" or "increment count". Function comments should describe **what** result the program achieves rather than **how** it achieves that result.

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
# Note that the usage of a set and a loop are implementation details,
# as in they describe HOW the method works.
# Returning the length of the set doesn't mean much to the clients.
def count_unique_characters(filename):
    """
    Opens the given file, loops through each character and adds them
    to a set. Returns the length of the set.
    """
    result = set()
    with open(filename) as f:
        content = f.read()
        for c in content:
            result.add(c)
    return len(result)
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
def count_unique_characters(filename):
    """
    Takes in a filename and returns the number of unique characters within
    the given file.
    """
    result = set()
    with open(filename) as f:
        content = f.read()
        for c in content:
            result.add(c)
    return len(result)
```
:::

Consider what a client would find useful. Documentation should contain all the necessary information needed to use a function. The exact details of how the function solves the problem is irrelevant, but the client needs to know the purpose of the parameters and the expected behavior. Avoid mentioning "the spec" or "the assessment" because clients won't know what this means unless they've also taken this course.

The documentation for test functions can be relatively simple. For example, the test function `test_add_two_numbers` could include the docstring, "Tests the function `add_two_numbers`".

## Logical refactoring

If the same lines of code appear in multiple places, reduce redundancy by refactoring.

### Conditional logic

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
# Note that there are repeated lines of logic that actually always happen,
# instead of conditionally like how our structure is set up. We can factor
# these out to simplify and clean our code.
if x % 2 == 0:
    print("Hello!")
    print("I love even numbers too.")
    print("See you later!")
else:
    print("Hello!")
    print("I don't like even numbers either.")
    print("See you later!")
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
print("Hello!")
if x % 2 == 0:
    print("I love even numbers too.")
else:
    print("I don't like even numbers either.")
print("See you later!")
```
:::

### Boolean zen

Avoid unnecessary comparisons to `True` and `False`. Remember to negate boolean values with the `not` operator.

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
if is_sunny:
    return True
else:
    return False
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
return is_sunny
```
:::

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
if is_sunny == True:
    go_hiking()
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
if is_sunny:
    go_hiking()
```
:::

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
return is_sunny == False
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
return not is_sunny
```
:::

### Loop zen

Choose loop bounds or loop conditions that generalize code the best.

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
total += l[0]
for i in range(1, len(l)):
    total += l[i]
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    total += l[i]
```
:::

Computation that only need to happen once should not be recomputed inside a loop.

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
# Note that the mean of the whole list remains unchanged for each loop iteration
# so it should be outside the loop to avoid unnecessary computation
def demean(l):
    """
    Takes in a list of numbers l and returns a new list with the mean
    value of the original list subtracted from each corresponding value
    """
    result = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        mean = sum(l) / len(l)
        result.append(l[i] - mean)
    return result
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
def demean(l):
    """
    Takes in a list of numbers l and returns a new list with the mean
    value of the original list subtracted from each corresponding value
    """
    result = []
    mean = sum(l) / len(l)
    for i in range(len(l)):
        result.append(l[i] - mean)
    return result
```
:::

Avoid unnecessary looping.

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
# Note that the total score for each sex could be computed at the same time
def get_total_for_each_sex(data):
    """
    Takes in data containing scores of students as a list of dictionaries.
    Returns a tuple containing the total score for each sex in the format
    of (male total, female total).
    """
    for row in data:
        if row['sex'] == 'M':
            male_total += row['score']
    for row in data:
        if row['sex'] == 'F':
            female_total += row['score']
    return male_total, female_total
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
def get_total_for_each_sex(data):
    """
    Takes in data containing scores of students as a list of dictionaries.
    Returns a tuple containing the total score for each sex in the format
    of (male total, female total).
    """
    for row in data:
        if row['sex'] == 'M':
            male_total += row['score']
        else:
            female_total += row['score']
    return male_total, female_total
```
:::

### Redundant cases

Avoid redundant cases. Before introducing a special case, think about whether a general case could compute the same result.

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
# Note the first case is unnecessary since if a == 0 and b != 0, a / b will
# still return 0.
def divide(a, b):
    """
    Takes in two numbers a, b and returns the result of a / b.
    Returns 0 if b == 0.
    """
    if a == 0:
        return 0
    elif b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return a / b
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
def divide(a, b):
    """
    Takes in two numbers a, b and returns the result of a / b.
    Returns 0 if b == 0.
    """
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return a / b
```
:::

## Program design

### Global variables

No global variables are allowed except for simple, fixed-value constants. Constants should be named using all uppercase characters.

### Unnecessary computation

Avoid computing unnecessary values.

:::{error} Bad
:class: code-example

```python
def get_average_score_for_sex(data, sex):
    """
    Takes in a DataFrame data containing scores for students and a sex and
    returns the average score for the given sex as a Series. Assume sex only
    takes the value 'M' (male) and 'F' (female).
    """
    male_avg = data[data['sex'] == 'M']
    female_avg = data[data['sex'] == 'F']
    if sex == 'M':
        return male_avg
    else:
        return female_avg
```
:::

:::{hint} Good
:class: code-example

```python
def get_average_score_for_sex(data, sex):
    """
    Takes in a DataFrame data containing scores for students and a sex and
    returns the average score for the given sex as a Series. Assume sex only
    takes the value 'M' (male) and 'F' (female).
    """
    return data[data['sex'] == sex]
```
:::

### Fit and finish

Remove all debugging print statements and fix all warnings and errors.
